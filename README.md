# Game_of_Life
Two implementations of Conway's Game of Life, one using the Long data type and the other using arrays
Some fun patterns to try : 
* Five phase oscillator : 0x1824428181422418
* Still life : 0x205032050502303
* Glider : 0x20A0600000000000

For TinyLife just pass in code, for ArrayLife pass in world size then code e.g. 12 0x1824428181422418
